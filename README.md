# Project Prahari (प्रहरी)

> An AI-powered sentinel that analyzes CCTV video in real-time to automatically detect critical events and alert emergency responders.

## Project Vision

Traditional CCTV monitoring is a passive process, relying on human operators to spot incidents after they occur. This can lead to critical delays in emergency response.

**Project Prahari** (Sanskrit for "The Sentinel") aims to transform surveillance into an active, intelligent safety system. By leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision, this project will analyze live video streams to automatically identify high-risk events such as fires, traffic accidents, and public violence.

The ultimate goal is to create a system that can send instant, automated alerts to the appropriate authorities (police, fire, or medical services) the moment an incident is detected, drastically reducing response times and helping to create safer communities.
